### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?
The topics discussed in the labs definitely help to get the fundamentals of javascript and it was up to me to see how it can apply to the website.
 It also required I learn outside of what was taught

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If i had more time, I would do more of the strtch features like add playlist and edit a playlist

* The javascript went well, but I wish I was able to make my website look prettier and work more on css
